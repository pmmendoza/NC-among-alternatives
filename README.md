## Replication instructions  
### Replication from scratch  
*0. Download this repository.*  _Download the entire repository, open an R session / in the same directory._
*1. Download the necessary datasets.*  
The analyses in this study are based on two other publicly available datasets cited in the paper:  
1. The voter component of the European Election Study (Schmitt et al. 2021). Dataset: https://search.gesis.org/research_data/ZA7581  
2. The EPEES_19 published as replication material (Nai et al. 2022). Dataset: https://osf.io/bzm48  

To be able to run this code you first need to manually download the EES datasets from the GESIS data archive.
After logging in to the GESIS data archive you can access the data here: https://search.gesis.org/research_data/ZA7581
Download the following two files and place them in the '/data' folder of your project directory.
1) 'ZA7581_v2-0-1.dta' - The full dataset. You can find this under 'Downloads > Datasets
2) 'ZA7581_cp.csv' - The party dataset. You can find this under 'Downloads > Other documents

*2. Run the data pre-processing file*


### Replication from analysis file
