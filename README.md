This is the official repository for all analyses conducted in: 
Mendoza, P., Nai, A., Bos, L. (2023). The fleeting allure of dark campaigns. Backlash from negative and uncivil campaigning in the presence of (better) alternatives. _Political Communication_ (_forthcoming_).


## Replication instructions  
### Replication from scratch  
*0. Download this repository.*  _Download the entire repository, open an R session / in the same directory._
*1. Download the necessary datasets.*  
The analyses in this study are based on two other publicly available datasets cited in the paper:  
1. The voter component of the European Election Study (Schmitt et al. 2021). Dataset: https://search.gesis.org/research_data/ZA7581  
2. The EPEES_19 published as replication material (Nai et al. 2022). Dataset: https://osf.io/bzm48  

To be able to run this code you first need to manually download the EES datasets from the GESIS data archive.
After logging in to the GESIS data archive you can access the data here: https://search.gesis.org/research_data/ZA7581
Download the following two files and place them in the '/data' folder of your project directory.
1) 'ZA7581_v2-0-1.dta' - The full dataset. You can find this under 'Downloads > Datasets
2) 'ZA7581_cp.csv' - The party dataset. You can find this under 'Downloads > Other documents

*2. Run the party matching script*  
The script '01_party-matching-EPEES-EES.R' links and matches parties in the Voter Component of the European Election Study (EES) to parties in the EPEES_2019, the 2019 European Parliament Election Expert Survey dataset.

The matching is done in two steps.
1. matching of parties via partyfacts.
   The EPEES dataset has a CHES id. Via the partyfacts database (https://partyfacts.herokuapp.com/)
   We can link this CHES id to the parties' ids for the previous edition of the EES14
   Whenever a EES party's EES19 id is also contained in the EES14, we complete the match.
2. manual matching.
   The remaining, unmatched parties in the EPEES were matched manually with EES19
   party ids. These manual matches are available in the repository under 'data/00_manual-matches-EPEESxEES.csv'.

The resulting file is... a linkage file




### Replication from analysis file  
To replicate the plots and tables presented in the paper, download the entire repository, open an R session in the same directory and run the analysis script and then the tables script.
